# 🚀 Loan Management System - Setup Guide

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ installed
- Node.js 16+ installed
- OpenAI API key (get from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

## 🔧 Backend Setup (FastAPI)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd loan-management-system
```

### 2. Create Python Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env file and add your OpenAI API key
# .env file should contain:
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
```

### 5. Start the Backend Server
```bash
# Option 1: Using the start script
python start_app.py

# Option 2: Using uvicorn directly
uvicorn loan_app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload

# Option 3: Using the integrated app
python start_integrated_app.py
```

The backend will be available at: `http://localhost:8001`

## 🎨 Frontend Setup (Next.js)

### 1. Navigate to Frontend Directory
```bash
cd Banking-Marketing-master
```

### 2. Install Node.js Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Frontend Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local file:
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8001
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=NextBank
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

### 4. Start the Frontend Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🤖 Available Loan Types

1. **Education Loan** - For students and educational expenses
2. **Home Loan** - For property purchase and construction
3. **Personal Loan** - For personal financial needs
4. **Business Loan** - For business expansion and operations
5. **Gold Loan** - Against gold collateral

## 🔒 Security Notes

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Never commit sensitive files to Git!

The following files contain sensitive information and are excluded from Git:
- `.env` - Contains API keys and secrets
- `Banking-Marketing-master/.env` - Frontend environment variables
- `customer_data/*/applications/` - Customer application data
- `models/*.pkl` - ML model files (optional)

### 🛡️ Environment Variables

Always use environment variables for:
- API keys (OpenAI, Stripe, etc.)
- Database URLs
- Secret keys
- Third-party service credentials

## 🧪 Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test the API endpoints
python test_backend_api.py

# Test individual loan services
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd Banking-Marketing-master
npm test
```

## 📊 Admin Dashboard

Access the admin dashboard at: `http://localhost:8001/admin`

Features:
- View loan applications
- Generate reports
- Monitor system performance
- Manage customer data

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Backend Deployment
1. Set up a production server (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
2. Install Python and dependencies
3. Set environment variables securely
4. Use a production WSGI server like Gunicorn
5. Set up reverse proxy with Nginx

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the Next.js application: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred hosting
3. Set production environment variables
4. Configure API endpoints for production

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **OpenAI API Key Error**
   - Ensure your API key is valid and has sufficient credits
   - Check that the key is properly set in the .env file

2. **Port Already in Use**
   - Change the port in the startup scripts
   - Kill existing processes using the port

3. **Module Not Found Errors**
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated
   - Reinstall dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. **Frontend API Connection Issues**
   - Verify backend is running on the correct port
   - Check CORS settings in the FastAPI application
   - Ensure API URL is correct in frontend .env file
